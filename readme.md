# üìâ Telco Churn Classification Project

**Customer churn** is one of the most important metrics for a growing business to evaluate. It‚Äôs far more cost-effective to retain an existing customer than to win one back after they‚Äôve left. Understanding and preventing customer churn is critical to long-term business success.

In this project, we use statistical testing and machine learning to identify key factors influencing churn, develop a predictive classification model, and provide actionable recommendations to reduce customer loss.

## üíº Business Goals

- Identify key drivers of customer churn at a telecom company  
- Construct a machine learning classification model to predict churn  
- Deliver a comprehensive report that a non-technical audience can understand  
- Provide churn predictions for a given customer list (via CSV)

## üìù Initial Questions

- Which features are most associated with churn?  
- Do customers who churn pay higher monthly charges?  
- Do churned customers have shorter tenure?  
- Are optional/add-on services related to churn?

## ü™ß Process

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Acquisition
- Load and explore the Telco customer churn dataset

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation
- Handle missing values, drop irrelevant columns, and encode categorical variables  
- Balance the dataset using **SMOTEENN**

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyze distributions and relationships between variables and churn  
- Visualize churn rates across various features using seaborn & matplotlib

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Statistical Testing & Modeling
- Conduct hypothesis tests (t-test, chi-square) to validate feature importance  
- Train a **Decision Tree Classifier**  
- Evaluate using confusion matrix, classification report, and recall score

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation
- Measure accuracy, recall, and precision  
- Focus on recall to catch most of the customers likely to churn  
- Optionally test other models like Logistic Regression or Random Forest
